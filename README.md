There is vaikuntha there lord is in 1000 head from called mahapurusha. Then after seeing brahma being pampered by lord vishnu he got happy. In satya loka happines is everlasting and distress is very minute as lord is himself there close to devotees.

He was serving lord for so ling then he always kept chanting his mantra. Even though he was lord of universe he thought of himself as simple devotee of lord. Then he was close to lord he committed offences but lord forgive them. Disciple should not be close to guru otherwise they commit offence. 

Then there was purans and upnashids having debate. Gopa kumara came to attend. Then conclusin was liberation is best. Then good devotional scriptures left devate. Bramha went to bring them back then bramaha inquired from bhagvatam the essence of life and liberation. They said liberation and knowledge attained is attachment. Liberation not better than bhakti
From bhakti comes love

Then lord vishnu explains him tattva and tells him to go back to vraja bhumi and meet your guru, he will enlighten you and you’ll see me again and enjoy with me.
Then re reaches vraja bhumi and everything is still same and he met his guru same place again and guru teah him worship knowledge then he vanishes. Then gopa kumara chant his mantra as guru told him and his body starts transforming into spiritual body and he starts travelling upward to other planetary systems

Then he reached covering of universe then saw goddess earth worshiping lord in boar form and she tried stopping him but he continued and reach for more high saw all incarnations of lord and passing water fire earth air layers. Then he reached prakirti layer there lord was in form of mohini murti and gave him so many yogic power and asked to stay but he still moved on as it was very colourful and beautiful. Then he crossed ignorance and bright lifht stuck his eyes and he made them close. And saw lord formless form with tracendental marks. Light from lords toe nail was so bright he would get scared and worried but rays also made him feel good and after looking around he saw lord shiva and heard music and dancing. He asked who is he. Nadi told haha he is lord of universe always absorved in thoughts of his lord. 
Then being happy he joined army of lord shive who was going to his adobe kailash. 

Then he heard singing and dancing of 4 kumaras all got so happy and lord shiva went in pream bhab after higging kumaras. He asked who is them they were from vaikuntha servants of lord krishna sri ganesha told gopa kumara. 
Then lord ganesha showed him many valuntas with lany headed brama taking care of it. Then told kumaras are from satya loka and came from visintg lord and so happy. If you want to se lord go to vaikuntha and gop kumara got so happy but distressed as he is unfot to go there. Then lord shove saw him crying and picked him up and told vaikuntha is hard to achieve even for me and brahma and all living entities. One who has done alll duties selflessly receive mercy of sri hari. If one receive mercy 100 times more they become brahma and more 100 times they become me and more 100 times go to vaikuntha. Lord shiva praised you’re born in Braja you are worthy of lord service and association and love. Then lord shiva associate praised lord Shiva and he remained silent. Then associte of lord shiva said your guru mathura braman jayanta is an incarnation of lord krishna. They told we all came for your sake. Give up your chanting and focus your jeart and mind with love on lotus feet of krishna. Sb 12.4.40 and 2.2.37. Then vaikuntha messengers say this process of devotion service of 9 forms easily give you prema for krishna lotus feet. And it is eternal proces not bodily mind and sense. If you want to go to vaikunth return to vraja practice pure bhakti. They told before liberation was top then remembering was top then chanting was top as it engages speech hearing and benefit others too. When one chant he quickly gains prema and mercy of lord. From SBB 3.45 worship part 2. Main outlines. When one chant prema floods in one’s heart. Then they told him nama sankirtan is most essential to please lord and have his audience to serve him. Then they told him to go vraj. He close his eys and moves forward and he is in  vraja in mathura. 

He wanders and found his Gurudev and he teaches him devotional service science and bhagvatam. Then he searches for his lord. Then he saw vaikunth servant came pick him up. He went on very oppulent and bringht plane and flew. He met all reaidents of different lolas and payed onesin es and they were happy for him. He got beautiful body. Then he reched gate of vaikuntha and gate keepres told him to wait they take permission of lord and then let you enter. But don’t worry meanwhile see thinngs and count how many things you saw nice ones. Then he saw one oppullent personality entering he thought its lord and screamied save me lord. That guy said omg my just servant of servant. And eachtome more beatiful person came and gopa kumara was awee. 

Then he saw variety of people in different form like animals, so many heads, so many hands etc went in and worshiped lord. Did many things. And gopa Kumara was amazed when servants and people jere are so opulent and beautiful how beautiful will be the lord. Then doorkepeers came back russing and told lord needs your presence. And he passed theough many gates and mistaking door keeprs as lord. Then assistants told him prayers and etiquette to follow in front of lord. Then passing through many districts and lanes he finally arrived at place of vaikunthanath. And saw him in full opulence.  SBB 4.64 lord narayan appearance. 

He was so happy to see lord Narayan there. Then he was his consorts like laxmi and bhumi and other associates like garuda. He was happy and doing his service there by playing flute for the lord. And sometimes lord would go to secret places with his intimate devotees. Gopa kumara would ask why he went. Nobody would tell him. Then he got sad and started missing vraja and krishna. Then narada muni came and saw him sad and was amazed to see someone sad in vaikuntha. He asked him. Gopa kumara said i miss lord in cowherd form and want personal association and love. Narada was amazed. So he told him intimate pastimes knowledge. Then told about laxmi as prakriti. And then lord krishna is supreme avatar as he is avatar and avatari. Then lord narada tells him confedentideal knowledge of prema, worship, bhakti and tells him to go to ayodhaya dham and then dwarika. 



## Part 3

Then gopa kumara came to dwaraka. He saw lord in his all opulence in his sudharma assembly hall and he was so beautiful with all hos associates like sri vasudeva king urrasena baladev akrura. And also his misinster vikadru and militray head krtavarma and lord narada was playing vina and entertaining lord. 

Then he met krishna and he took his flute and got emotional. And told uddhava to keep gopa kumara in his house. Then lord narada came to udhava house. Then lord narada told scientific devotion knowledge to him. How goois are pure and highest. And to attain love one pust take shelter of gopis and to attain love of god amp ne must be humble and if something stops you from being humble avoid it. 

Then after talking so much about vraja bhumi. Lord narada suggested gopa kumara to go to purrshotaM ksetra. But then uddhava said it’s waste of time. You meed lord lotus feet so go directly to goloka. 

Then he reaches there and in separation fell unconscious. Then krishna comes and wakes him up. Sbb 6.7. 

Then Krishna disappeared as he tried getting hold of his yellow cloth. Then falling in ecstasy he fell unconscious and fell in Yamuna and drove by the currents. Then he got conciseness and saw being carried by beautiful vehicle on beautiful path as he crossed all the lokas he visited before. And then he reacher sri goloka. And heard kansa is there and all krishna leela story begins as same.
Then he saw the not seen ever. He asked people where is krishna and stuff. But all seemed to be in ecstasy mood. Then somehow he travelled and reached town. And felt great pleasure being there. Then he asked one lady where is krishna and stuff she said he’s on this way to return. And then gopa kumara heard Krishna’s flute and dust. 

Then he saw Gopis rushing forward to greet him with al things like pooja stuff and eatables ready for krishnas enjoyment. Since krishna was near tjere was extreme aura of happiness around all. Then some fell unconscious some stunned some clothes or belts or hairs in disarray. Gopis were far more beautiful then laxmi. Then gopa kumara also rushed to see him. And from distance krishna told look sridama my dear friend sarupa is here. Then gooa kumara saw all the beautiful features of krishna flute hair locks lips eyes colour clothes and all. Then krishna came and hugged gopa kumara both fell unconscious and started crying. Then gopa kumara got conciseness and saw krishna still unconscious. And all vrajavasi gathered. All animals came lord balarama came krishnas parents came gopis game. All gave who is this bad person made krishan cry and unconscious. Then lord balarama came quickly and told gop kumara to hold krishna by head and go wuickly to house. And krishna got little conciseness and hugged gopa kumara and kisses him. And then felt shy. Then reaching home he greered all and then started getting ready for bath. But gopis came, and krishna told please make food ready gopis will give bath. Then they gave lord balarama bath and send him off. Then krishna was getting bath with their own garments.  Then some tried taking flute. Krishna gave sign to gopa kumara to catch it. Then they gave krishna bath and joinkgly krishnas nurse mukhara gave joke made yashoda angry. Then they finushed and started eating. Gop kumara was sitting in front of krishna. Balaram to right and left krishan to Nanda maharaj. Then he fed both child. Krishna fed me also. They ate so much stuff. Then radhika came brought manohar ladoo. Krishna made joke that its bitter and gave all ladoo to me. Then they washed eat pan and gave pan to goo kumara. Thrn krishna wandered in vraja and came back as mom called. Then he slept for some tome and then gopis pastimes of night started. And morning krishna was still sleeping and yashoda came and saw marks and thought gopis didn’t give him bath properly but all those were marks from gopis intimate pastines with krishna in night. 

Then krishna left for forest pastimes but all of vraja vasis created problem as all love krishna so much. Then krishna heard kaliya came back. He went quick and jumped into Yamuna. Then he started playing games. All vraja vasis heard kaliya got krishna. All got worried and came to yamuna all crying sobbing fainting. Then balram told stop games and finish this. Then krishna got on top of kaliya. Did rasa dance. Then later kesi and arista came. Krishna kicked kesi then toook arista to gopishwara. And kept both demons for daily work of braja. All the pastimes are eternal and repets again and again. Everybody forgets what happened before, but their love every time is more and more. Then akrura comes to take krishna and creates so much emotion pain to everybody. Then he takes krishna and then kills kamsa. Then Uddhav come back tells what’s happening in vraja without you and krishna goes back to vraja until all forgets that he ever left. And all the seperation and reunion lila occurs again and again. Then swarup says I’ve told you all the confidential pastimes. And I don’t see any difference between goloka and gokula here. All is same, nobody should discriminate between two as they as same. 
Even when krishna is not in vraja. Nobody wants to leave vraja. Separation mood is more to vrajavasis.  One should be shy to reveal these pastimes to others. Earlier srimati radharani came to me to tell all things to you. 

When sarupa saw brahmana still didn’t reach highest love. He put his hand on brahmanas head. And all the relisations manifested inside brahmana. They both went mad and calling out to krishna. Then they heard flute and cows and went to the sound, and then they saw Krishna’s beautiful form.  Chapter 7 text 9 to 41 Krishna description.  Then krishna names brahmana as sri janashrama. And pleases him hugs him talks to him. The best he could do is offer himself to brahmana. Then he made sound and made cows drink water and then played in yamuna water with all. Saying all those pastimes all waere pleased. Then Parikshit maharaj tells his mother i have told you all the stuff now you desice what to do. When hearing this that krishna story is about to finish janmajaya gets worried and ask jaimi rishi to tell more.
